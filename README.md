## Challenge 1 - capitalize()
makes the first character of a given string uppercase.

## Challenge 2 - allCaps()
makes all characters uppercase.

## Challenge 3 - capitalizeWords()
makes the first character of each word uppercase. Imagine that each word is separated by a space.

## Challenge 4 - removeExtraSpaces()
Removes all spaces from the beginning and end of a String along with any extra spaces in the middle. If more than one space appears in the middle of a string it is replaced by a single space.

## Challenge 5 - kebabCase()
Removes extra spaces and replaces spaces with the hyphen "-", and makes all characters lowercase.

## Challenge 6 - snakeCase()
Removes extra space and replaces spaces with an underscore "_", and makes all characters lowercase.

## Challenge 7 - camelCase()
Lowercases the first character of the first word. Then uppercases the first character of all other words, and removes all spaces.

## Challenge 8 - shift()
this method will take the first character of a string and move to the end of a string:

## Challenge 9 - makeHashtag()
This function should convert the given string to a hash tag. A hash tag begins with # and no spaces. Each word in the phrase begins with an uppercase letter.

## Challenge 10 - isEmpty()
Returns true if the given string is empty or contains only whitespace. White space includes: spaces, line returns, and tabs. These characters can be represented with: \n (new line) \r (carrige return), \t (tab).

## Challenge 11 - readme
Add a readme.md to your GitHub Repo. In this file you will document your library of string functions.

Also include a link to your library on npm. You'll be publishing this npm in class 2.
